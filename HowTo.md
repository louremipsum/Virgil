# How To Setup and Run the Project

## Prerequsites

First we will setup the databases which we will use in our project, MongoDB is used for storing the scrapped documents and MongoDB Atlas for Search Index which will be used for finding the data and query(Mongo Realm). Redis is used for storing queue(list) of unvisited links while scraping using RedisSpider.
