# Virgil

A minimal search engine implementation using ReactJS, Scappy and other technologies

## Inspiration

We have named it Virgil as taken inspiration from Virgil who is a well-known and respected figure in literature and specifically from Dante's Divine Comedy. In Dante's Divine Comedy, Virgil serves as Dante's guide through the depths of Hell and Purgatory. He is a symbol of reason and wisdom, helping Dante navigate the complex moral and theological landscape of the afterlife. Throughout their journey, Virgil provides Dante with guidance, encouragement, and insight, ultimately leading him towards salvation in Paradise.

While we don't take responsibility that our search engine will give you enlightenment(haha) but it sure will guide you to great results!
